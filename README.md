# GPM (German Pronounce & Meaning)

GPM is a **fun, offline Chrome extension** I built to help myself learn German words while reading websites.  

Whenever you highlight a German word, GPM instantly tells the English meaning and speaks it a loud  **all offline**! No data is sent or received. Everything runs locally in your browser.

This project is mostly for **fun and personal learning**, but it’s open-source so anyone can use it or contribute.

## Features

- Offline German English word lookup  
- Text to speech pronunciation  
- Easy to update the dictionary by editing `german_dict.json`  
- Lightweight and private  

## Credits

The dictionary used in this project is taken from [hathibelagal/German-English-JSON-Dictionary](https://github.com/hathibelagal/German-English-JSON-Dictionary). Huge thanks to them for providing this free resource! 🙏

## Usage

1. Install the extension from the Chrome “Load unpacked” option.  
2. Highlight any German word on a website.  
3. Hear and see its English meaning instantly.
